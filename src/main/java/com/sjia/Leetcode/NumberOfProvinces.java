    /*
    There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

    A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

    You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

    Return the total number of provinces.

    Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]  Output: 2

    Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]  Output: 3

    1 <= n <= 200
