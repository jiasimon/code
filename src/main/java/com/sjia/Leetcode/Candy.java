    There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.
    Each child must have at least one candy.
    Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
    Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

    Input: ratings = [1,0,2]    Output: 5
    Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

    Input: ratings = [1,2,2]    Output: 4
    Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.

    n == ratings.lengthï¼Œ 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
    0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10^4
